This repository contains Python implementations of various numerical methods commonly used in scientific computing. The implemented methods are as follows:

## Bisection Method
The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that works by repeatedly bisecting an interval and selecting the subinterval in which a root exists.

## Euler's Method
Euler's method is a simple numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations. It approximates the solution by taking small steps along the tangent line at each point.

## Gauss-Jordan Method
The Gauss-Jordan method is an algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations by performing elementary row operations on an augmented matrix.

## General Iterative Method
The general iterative method is an iterative technique used to solve nonlinear equations by repeatedly applying an iterative formula until convergence is achieved.

## Jacobi Method
The Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations. It updates each variable by using the values from the previous iteration.

## Newton's Method
Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm that works by iteratively improving an initial guess for the root using the derivative of the function.

## Runge-Kutta Method
The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical integration technique used to solve ordinary differential equations. It provides a more accurate approximation than Euler's method.

## Secant Method
The secant method is a root-finding algorithm that works by iteratively constructing secant lines between two points and selecting the next point where the secant line intersects the x-axis.

Feel free to explore each method's implementation in the respective Python files provided in this repository. Happy coding!
